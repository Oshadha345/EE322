# Capstone: Deterministic Embedded System

The capstone consolidates all layers into one measurable, robust embedded system.

## Candidate Project

Deterministic motor supervisor with:
- State machine for safe mode transitions.
- Timer-driven control and monitoring loop.
- Fault detection and bounded recovery behavior.

## Required Evidence

1. Architecture diagram.
2. Timing budget table.
3. Latency and jitter measurement set.
4. Flashing and fuse safety compliance notes.
