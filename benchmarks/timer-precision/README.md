# Timer Precision

## Objective

Characterize timer-generated output frequency and jitter against theoretical values.

## Protocol

1. Configure timer mode and compare settings.
2. Output periodic signal on pin.
3. Measure period/frequency over many samples.
4. Report error percentage and jitter envelope.
