# Benchmark Suite

Benchmarking is mandatory for timing claims.

## Sections

- `cycle-counting/`: instruction and path-level cycle accounting.
- `interrupt-latency/`: interrupt response envelope under varied load.
- `timer-precision/`: periodic signal accuracy and jitter.

## Artifact Requirements

1. Measurement setup diagram.
2. Raw data log.
3. Derived metrics.
4. Commit/toolchain metadata.
