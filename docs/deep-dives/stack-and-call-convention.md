# Deep Dive: Stack and Call Convention

## Scope

- Stack pointer initialization and growth direction.
- Function call/return mechanics.
- ISR context save/restore implications.

## Study Outcomes

1. Trace stack evolution for nested calls and interrupts.
2. Estimate stack usage budget for each lab.
3. Identify stack-corruption signatures.
