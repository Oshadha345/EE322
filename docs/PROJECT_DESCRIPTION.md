# GitHub Project Description

## Long Description

Embedded Systems From First Principles is a professional learning repository focused on deep ATmega328P understanding: register-level firmware in AVR C/assembly, deterministic design, safe flashing practices, and cycle-level timing analysis with measured real-time behavior.

## Short Description (Repository About Field)

ATmega328P deep-dive: deterministic AVR C/ASM, timing analysis, safe flashing, and real-time design from first principles.
