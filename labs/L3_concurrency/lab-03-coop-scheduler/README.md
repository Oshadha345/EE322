# Lab 03: Cooperative Scheduler

## Objective

Implement a cooperative scheduler with fixed-period tasks and explicit runtime bounds.

## Focus

- Task descriptors (`period`, `deadline`, `next_release`).
- Run-to-completion discipline.
- Deadline miss logging.

## Exit Criteria

- Deterministic schedule for nominal task set.
- Measured CPU load and overrun behavior.
