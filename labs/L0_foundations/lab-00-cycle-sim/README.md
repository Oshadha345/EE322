# Lab 00: Cycle Simulation Baseline

## Objective

Create a minimal Python model that simulates execution cycles for a constrained AVR-like instruction subset.

## Deliverables

1. Opcode execution model.
2. Cycle accounting per instruction.
3. Comparison table against ATmega328P datasheet timing.

## Exit Criteria

- Simulator output is deterministic and reproducible.
- Cycle discrepancies are documented with assumptions.
