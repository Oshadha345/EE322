- `L0_foundations`
- `L1_register-control`
- `L2_timing-mastery`

- `L4_real-time-design`

## Lab Entry Format

Each lab should include:
1. Objective
2. Hardware setup
3. Register map touched
4. Build and flash steps
5. Timing analysis
6. Failure cases
7. Next lab dependency

## Naming

`lab-XX-topic-goal`  
Example: `lab-02-timer0-ctc`
